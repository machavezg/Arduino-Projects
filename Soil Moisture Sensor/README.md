Solar Powered Particle Photon Soil Moisture Alarm
---------------------------------------

**Introduction**

For a while I've had a small solar panel, rechargeable battery and a solar battery charger sitting at my desk. After a month of having bought a basil plant, I've decided to create a notification system that will automatically notify me once my plant needs water. After searching around for a similar projects, I found [this example](https://www.hackster.io/AlexWulff/annoying-soil-moisture-sensor-with-photon-and-ifttt-549222). I've decided to use some of the hardware components in that project along with the components I've had lying around.

**Hardware Components**

1. [Particle Photon](https://www.adafruit.com/product/2721)
2. [Gravity: Analog Capacitive Soil Moisture Sensor- Corrosion Resistant](http://a.co/cACKNFt) or [Here](https://www.dfrobot.com/product-1385.html)
3. [Large 6V 3.5W Solar panel - 3.5 Watt](https://www.adafruit.com/product/500)
