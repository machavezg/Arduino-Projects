#Instructions
<p>BreadBoardServo was the first part of this project, the purpose of this code was to learn how to control the 
MG995 servos and learn their angular limitations with respect to my robot arm
<p>AdafruitServoBoard was writted next in order to learn how to use the servo shield that is going to be used to operate 4 servos
<p>WiiChuck is a simple code that is being used to learn how to operate the arm using a wii nunchuck
